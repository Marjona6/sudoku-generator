## Technical Details

### Algorithm

The Sudoku generator uses a sophisticated algorithm:

1. **Solution Generation**:

   - Starts by filling the three diagonal 3x3 boxes
   - Uses backtracking to complete the rest of the grid
   - Ensures a unique, valid solution

2. **Puzzle Creation**:

   - Copies the complete solution
   - Randomly removes cells based on difficulty level
   - Maintains puzzle solvability

3. **Validation**:
   - Real-time checking of row, column, and box constraints
   - Visual feedback for invalid moves
   - Win condition detection

switch (difficulty) {
  case "easy":
    cellsToRemove = 30; // Adjust this number
    break;
  case "medium":
    cellsToRemove = 45; // Adjust this number
    break;
  case "hard":
    cellsToRemove = 55; // Adjust this number
    break;
}
```
